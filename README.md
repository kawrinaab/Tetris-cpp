# Tetris in C++ using Raylib

A clean and minimal implementation of **Tetris** built using **C++** and the **Raylib** graphics library.  
This project focuses on using a **2D array** as the primary data structure to represent the game grid, while maintaining clear logic for piece movement, collision detection, and row clearing.

##  Features

- Smooth Tetris gameplay using Raylib rendering  
- 20x10 grid implemented using a **2D integer array**  
- Detects full rows and shifts blocks down  
- Colored tetromino rendering  
- Efficient logic for movement & boundary checking  
- Highly readable and modular C++ code

##  Tech Stack

- **C++ (17/20 standard)**
- **Raylib** (installed locally or via Homebrew on macOS)
- **VSCode** (recommended development environment)
- **2D Array Grid System**

## Time Complexity
1. Grid Initialization

Loops over all 20×10 cells
→ O(R × C) → O(200) → O(1)

2. Drawing the Grid

Executed every frame
→ O(R × C) → O(1)

3. Checking if a Row Is Full

Loops over 10 columns
→ O(C) → O(1)

4. Clearing Full Rows

Worst-case: clear all 20 rows
→ O(R × C) → O(1) (grid size fixed)

5. Collision Detection

Direct access to array index
→ O(1)
